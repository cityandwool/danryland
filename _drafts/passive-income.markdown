_'I make money while you sleep'_

In reading this one simple line did you picture a banker or some 'up-all-night' stock trader?

I did.

Video content, or better still Youtube videos, could be your best passive income generator.

More viewers that engage in the advertisments presented, the higher your chances of increasing revenue.

Making money while you sleep sounds like it could be a reality.
