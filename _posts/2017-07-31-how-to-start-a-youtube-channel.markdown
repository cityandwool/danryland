Reading and writing blogs can broadening perspective and strengthening your writing skills.

At University we were all encouraged to document our critical thinking and creative process by blogging. We'd consistently add to our [personal blog](http://cityandwool.blogspot.co.uk/) over the three years of study.

After months of writing blog posts, I decided to do something different, to learn a new skill; vlogging (video blogging).

I started to simply recording short videos and not edit or cut any of my mistakes to give me an idea of how good I was.

Over 10 short videos I saw vast improvements in my confidence and communication.

Now married to a gorgeous [corporate lawyer come vlogger](http://kimaonline.com), I've decided to start vlogging again.

You can [subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-juA1PYRWYqD7Dym65g4HQ) to watch my videos. Here's my first:

</div>

Also three channels that have inspired me to vlog:

- [Steven Bartlett's Everyday Steve](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LOoFtney1PI4La_edqz0w)
- [Gary Vaynerchuk's daily vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/user/GaryVaynerchuk)
- [Craig Groeschel's leadership podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX95oYDB_nU&list=PLXvTERtQ_HV-wSR_EaHfphJ4RdVyFXWx5)

So in starting again, I now wanted to share the lessons I'm learning and the benefits I'm seeing.

I'll also keep adding to this list as an encouragement to others who are thinking about vlogging for themselves.

## Benefits of vlogging ##

### 1. Become a better communicator and story teller ###

Vlogging has increased my confidence in-front of a camera.

It's helped to unite my thinking with my speaking so there are less 'umming' and 'aring'.

### 2. Diversify your content ###

Video content in my opinion is more engaging than written content.

It also increases time spend on your site or page as users are more likely to watch a video rather than read a long post.

### 3. Connect with your audience and gets your personality across ###

I'm now contributing to the YouTube community. I'm sharing more about myself, my personality and my life.

### 4. Learn new skills ###

I'm learning new skills in video editing and video marketing.

I'm currently just using iMove to edit and some search engine optimisation (SEO) tips to craft optimising video content.
