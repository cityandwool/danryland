Think of three people in your life that appreciate and value you.

What's common between them?

Could it be how they listen to you? For me, it is.

When they listen, it makes me feel valued.

From people to products, customers need the same.

To feel valued.

Consider not only listening, but watching too.

Their interactions with your product or website can sometimes show much more than just words or an opinion.

In putting your customers above your own interests you'll produce a product that your customers will love.

Consider these within your products:

## Collecting user feedback ##
Use heatmaps, visitor recordings and conversion tunnels. Hotjar is a fantastic place to start.

## Iterate often ##
Using your data, craft better solutions and implement quickly.

## Keep going back for more ##
Keep listening and watching to see how your improvements are performing. Whether they're having a positive impact on your user engagement or increase conversions.

How often do you listen or watch?
