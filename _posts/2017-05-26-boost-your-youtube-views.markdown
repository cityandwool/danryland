YouTube could become your best passive income generator.

You _know_ you have great videos, you have monitisation enabled and now you're glued to your analytics.

In my case, I'm glued to my fiance's analytics.

I use all the techniques outline below to optimise her videos.

If you're interested in relationships, fashion or corporate law [you should follow KimaOnline](https://www.youtube.com/user/KimaOnline).

_Plug over, I promise._

Also a note of warning before we continue: Patiences is required.

Following these simple steps to optimise your YouTube videos could see your revenue increase **over time**.

So here we go:

## Get the YouTube Creator Studio app ##

Whether you have an [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.creator&referrer=utm_source%3Dyoutube_hc) or an [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id888530356?pt=9008&ct=youtube_hc&mt=8), consider downloading the YouTube Creator Studio app.

It's filled with useful data, graphs and helpful analysis on all of your videos.

The Creator app will help track the effectiveness of your changes in increasing your views.

## Experiment with some keyword research ##

Under the 'Audience' tab within your Creator app, you'll be able to see which countries view your videos the most.

Using this data, jump over to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/) and let's geek out on search terms.

For our [Nigerian Wedding White Guy Dances Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqlV7gYPvOg), I looked at some variations to produce the best results.

Within Google Trends, you can compare search terms from selected countries.

### Keyword research around 'weddings' ###

Here's some YouTube search data for the following key phrases:

- Black Wedding
- African Wedding
- Nigerian Wedding

#### United States, past 12 months ####

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1015_RC10/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"black wedding","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"african wedding","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"nigerian wedding","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":"youtube"}, {"exploreQuery":"date=today%2012-m&geo=US&gprop=youtube&q=black%20wedding,african%20wedding,nigerian%20wedding","guestPath":"https://trends.google.co.uk:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>


#### United Kingdom, past 12 months ####

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1015_RC10/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"black wedding","geo":"GB","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"african wedding","geo":"GB","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"nigerian wedding","geo":"GB","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":"youtube"}, {"exploreQuery":"date=today%2012-m&geo=GB&gprop=youtube&q=black%20wedding,african%20wedding,nigerian%20wedding","guestPath":"https://trends.google.co.uk:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

Although we decided to go for 'Nigerian wedding', 'Black wedding' from a purely optimisation perspective could have proven better for natural search discovery.

You could even go one step further and look at [search term variations](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=today%2012-m&geo=US&gprop=youtube&q=white%20guy,white%20man,white%20boy) for white guy, white man and white boy.

## Add keywords to your video ##

As a YouTube veteran, you will have heard of the 'boyfriend tag' - an introduction to someone's relationship through [stories that the boyfriend tells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSKcp4dRT54).

In publishing your _boyfriend tag_, you want to focus on those exact keywords. You should include those keywords...

1. at the start of your title
2. within your description
3. within the videos meta data (keywords)

You can again use Google Trends to help you discover related queries. I'd suggest adding some of these into your bank of keywords.

## Create a great thumbnail ##

Once you've got your content optimised, you'll then need to think about your thumbnail design.

Two things I've experimented with recently:

Try to disrupt the visual flow of the search results. Do this by adding more whitespace or changing the shape of your thumbnail.

Consider adding some sort of frame to again make the content of your thumbnail stand out against other videos.

## Review search terms ##

Once your video has been public for some time, you'll start to see how well it's performing.

Under the 'Discovery' tab within your Creator app, you'll find 'Top YouTube search terms'. This is a list of search terms used to find your video.

You should consider adding these terms to your video's meta data to make it more discoverable.

To optimise your YouTube video, follow these 5 steps:

1. Get the YouTube Creator Studio app
2. Experiment with some keyword research
3. Add keywords to your video
4. Create a great thumbnail
5. Review search terms

Hope you enjoy seeing those view counts rise.
